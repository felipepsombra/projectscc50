# CC50 Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various programming exercises from the CC50 course. The CC50 course, also known as "Introduction to Computer Science", provided a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of programming.

Each exercise is implemented in C and demonstrates my understanding of different programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. The solutions are organized into separate directories, with each directory representing a specific problem or topic covered in the course.

## Table of Contents

- [Problem 1: Mario](./mario)
- [Problem 2: Cash](./cash)
- [Problem 3: Credit Card Validation](./credit)
- [Problem 4: Population growth](./population)
- [Problem 5: Reading levels](./readability)
- [Problem 6: Caesar cipher](./caesar)

## Usage

Each solution is contained within its respective directory. To run any of the programs, navigate to the specific directory and follow the instructions provided in the respective README file.

## Contributions

While these solutions represent my own work, I welcome any suggestions or improvements. If you have a better or more efficient solution to any of the problems, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors and staff of the CC50 course for providing an excellent learning experience. Their guidance and support have been invaluable in my journey to become a better programmer.
